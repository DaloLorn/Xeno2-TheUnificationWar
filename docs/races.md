# Races

## Preface

- Cleaner Agents have starting stats within a reasonable margin of Xenonauts, so I'm going to interpret them as "average human" for defector NCE and alien rank progression.
- PSI progression is not currently visible on the UI, and it might not even have a progression mechanism, so I'm going to cheat and pin these to a racial baseline, with occasional equipment modifiers. (Not that I expect to even be able to use PSI-scaled abilities as a player...)
- Higher-ranked aliens *should* have better stats to represent veterancy, but they still want to be clamped to 100 unless they're mechanical (and thus have fixed stats).

## Human

- Baseline TU/HP/ACC/STR/REF/BRA: 50/40/42/50/50/50
- SEN (vis range/night min-max/cone, audio): 26/2-16/45, 12
  - Cleaners need to be updated to this, they're currently using alien stats.
  - Night-vision goggles could be interesting. A bit of added weight to boost human visual acuity... probably standard issue for Cleaner Soldiers.
  - All non-Agent/General Cleaners have Accelerated weapons:
    - Leader: Pistol/Rifle
    - Soldier: Rifle/Pistol+Ballistic Shield/Sniper/LMG
    - Armored Soldier: Shotgun/Rifle
  - Cleaner Soldiers have a 50% chance of Frag and Flash grenades (independent rolls, can get both).
- Chance to stop bleeding: 25%
